# 2. Available in the main prefetch list (verified to exist)

# If renaming/moving this file, update the reference in scripts/ci/lib.sh

# Used by tests/yamls/multi-container-pod.yaml (TestPod, TestContainerInstances, roxctl verification)

# NOTE: The following images are used by other e2e tests but are NOT in the main
# prefetch list and may require special credentials or will be pulled on-demand:
#
# - quay.io/rhacs-eng/qa:nginx-1-14-alpine (resourcecollection_test.go)
# - registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi-minimal:* (delegated_scanning_test.go, requires QUAY_RHACS_ENG_RO_* credentials)
# - quay.io/rhacs-eng/qa:dele-scan-* (delegated_scanning_test.go, requires QUAY_RHACS_ENG_RO_* credentials)
#
# These tests may fail in CI environments without proper credentials configured.
