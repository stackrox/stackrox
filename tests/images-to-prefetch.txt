# This is a minimal subset of qa-tests-backend/scripts/images-to-prefetch.txt,
# containing only images that are:
# 1. Actually used by the Go e2e test suite
# 2. Available in the main prefetch list (verified to exist)
#
# If renaming/moving this file, update the reference in scripts/ci/lib.sh

# Used by tests/yamls/multi-container-pod.yaml (TestPod, TestContainerInstances, roxctl verification)
