# Some common style settings for Konflux YAML files.

# This config is for https://github.com/adrienverge/yamllint tool.
# The main purpose is to ensure consistent indentation in each file so that when MintMaker (or its dependency) makes
# an update to our pipelines, it does not mess up the formatting. See https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ROX-30101 for
# context links if you need to learn more.

# If you'd like to run the tool locally, you can do the following (in this directory):
# $ docker run --rm -it -v .:/source -w /source --entrypoint=/bin/bash registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/python-312
# $ pip3 install yamllint
# $ yamllint .

- '*.yaml'
- '*.yml'
- '.yamllint'
