// Package rhel provides a forked implementation of the ClairCore RHEL updater.
// It is meant to be a TEMPORARY divergence from upstream ClairCore. This package
// is introduced as a simple workaround for obtaining Red Hat's CVSS scores for
// vulnerabilities, as it tends to be preferred to use Red Hat's CVSS scores for
// Red Hat products instead of NVD's.
//
// This package is expected to only exist temporarily until ClairCore switches
// over from the current OVAL v2 feeds to the upcoming CSAF/VEX feeds[1]. This
// change is expected to take place early 2024, so the StackRox team is willing
// to live with this temporary divergence, as we know the CSAF/VEX migration will
// happen.
//
// The contents of this package are almost entirely copied from claircore[2],
// except for:
//
//  1. The [Severity] field's contents are replaced with an urlencoded key/values
//     containing the severity and additional CVSS base score/vector, and
//
//  2. A workaround to overcome the limitations of OVAL regarding unfixed
//     OpenShift vulns.
