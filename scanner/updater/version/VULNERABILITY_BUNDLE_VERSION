# This file lists ACS Scanner v4 vulnerability definitions versions.
# Each vulnerability definitions version is linked to a product tag.
# The scanner updaters for the associated tag are responsible for regularly updating the vulnerability data for the associated definition bundle.
# The updated data is then uploaded to Google Storage.
# Each vulnerability definition version serves the Scanner requesting it, and the definitions are imported to that specific Scanner.
# This process ensures that each version's vulnerability data is accurately captured and maintained in accordance with its respective version.
