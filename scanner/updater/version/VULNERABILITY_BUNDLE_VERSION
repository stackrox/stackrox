# This file lists Scanner V4 vulnerability definitions versions.
# Each vulnerability bundle version is linked to a git reference, which may be changed.
# The vulnerability updater for each associated reference is responsible for regularly updating the vulnerabilities for the associated bundle.
# The updated data is uploaded to Google Cloud Storage.
# Each vulnerability bundle version serves the Scanner V4 requesting it, which is, by default, based on the version specified in scanner/VULNERABILITY_VERSION in the related Scanner V4 tag.
# This process ensures that each version's vulnerability data is accurately captured and maintained in accordance with its respective version.
