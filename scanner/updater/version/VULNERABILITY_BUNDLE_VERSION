# This file lists ACS Scanner v4 vulnerability definition versions.
# Each version is linked to a branch of the codebase that exports that specific version.
# The scanner updaters for the associated branch are responsible for regularly updating the vulnerability data for that definition bundle.
# The updated data is then uploaded to Google Storage.
# Each vulnerability definition version serves the Scanner requesting it, and the definitions are imported to that specific Scanner.
# This process ensures that each version's vulnerability data is accurately captured and maintained in accordance with its respective version.
