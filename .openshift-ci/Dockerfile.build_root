# This file is *not used* as the build_root in CI. Instead a mirrored image is
# used for performance reasons. See the build_root: in:
# https://github.com/openshift/release/blob/master/ci-operator/config/stackrox/stackrox/stackrox-stackrox-master.yaml

# However this file can be used to validate proposed changes to
# stackrox/rox-ci-image. And this is why the automation in that repo will update
# this file when it creates dependent PRs and
# `stackrox-update-ci-image-from-<rox-ci-image PR>` branches e.g.
# https://github.com/stackrox/stackrox/pull/2762

# In order to validate a new version of the test environment:
# - open a PR in openshift/release (this is just for test. mark the PR with `/hold` and
#   `/uncc` autoassigned reviewers to reduce noise)
# - rename the main branch CI workflow to a workflow that tests the stackrox/stackrox
#   PR branch, specifically
#   - git mv `stackrox-stackrox-master.yaml` to `stackrox-stackrox-stackrox-update-ci-image-from-<rox-ci-image PR number>.yaml`
#     in `ci-operator/config/stackrox/stackrox/` folder
#   - change the zz_generated_metadata.branch to stackrox-update-ci-image-from-<rox-ci-image PR number>
#   - change the build_root to:
#     project_image:
#       dockerfile_path: .openshift-ci/Dockerfile.build_root
# - run openshift/release automation to generate the prow config, specifically
#   - run `make update` locally, commit the results, and push them to the test PR in
#     openshift/release you created earlier
#   - say `/test pj-rehearse-max` on the openshift/release PR to validate the change

# For an example, see https://github.com/stackrox/stackrox/pull/2762 and its counterpart
# https://github.com/openshift/release/pull/31561
