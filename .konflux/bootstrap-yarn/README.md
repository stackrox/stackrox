# bootstrap-yarn

This directory is for getting `yarn` package manager in the `ui-builder` stage of `main` `Dockerfile` in Konflux builds.

`package*.json` files configure a pseudo npm project that has a single dependency - `yarn`. This allows getting `yarn` package with Cachi2 via its [npm support](https://github.com/containerbuildsystem/cachi2/blob/main/docs/npm.md).

`yarn` version should be kept in sync with the one used for UI builds.

`package*.json` files were generated by running `npm init` and `npm install yarn@^1.22` in this directory and can be recreated the same way.
