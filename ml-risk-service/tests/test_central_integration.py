"""
Integration test for Central API training data collection and prediction validation.

This test validates the entire ML pipeline end-to-end:
1. Pull real training data from Central
2. Train ML model on subset of data
3. Make predictions on held-out deployments
4. Compare predicted vs actual risk scores

Requires:
- CENTRAL_API_TOKEN environment variable
- Access to a running StackRox Central instance
