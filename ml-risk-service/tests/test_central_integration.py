"""
Integration test for Central API training data collection and prediction validation.

This test validates the entire ML pipeline end-to-end:
1. Pull real training data from Central (pre-extracted features and risk scores)
2. Train ML model on subset of data
3. Make predictions on held-out deployments
4. Compare predicted vs actual risk scores

Note: Central service returns training samples with pre-computed features via
create_training_sample(), not raw deployment data.

Requires:
- TRAINING_CENTRAL_API_TOKEN environment variable
- Access to a running StackRox Central instance
