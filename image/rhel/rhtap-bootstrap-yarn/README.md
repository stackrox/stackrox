# rhtap-bootstrap-yarn

This directory is for getting `yarn` package manager in the `ui-builder` stage of `main` `Dockerfile` in RHTAP.

The `package*.json` files configure a pseudo npm project that has a dependency on `yarn`. They allow getting `yarn` package with Cachi2.

The version of `yarn` must be kept in sync with the one used for UI builds.

`package*.json` files were generated by running `npm init` and `npm install yarn@^1.22` and can be recreated the same way.
