# StackRox Kubernetes Security Platform - Central Services Chart
# PRIVATE configuration file.
#
# This file contains sensitive values relevant for the deployment of the
# StackRox Kubernetes Platform Central Services components.
#
# Apart from image pull secrets (see below), all the values in this file are
# optional or can be automatically generated at deployment time.
# Moreover, this file does not need to be provided (e.g., via `-f`) to a `helm upgrade`
# command, even if custom values are used - the previously set values
# will simply be preserved.
#
# The following values typically require user input, as they cannot be automatically generated
# (though each of them can be omitted):
# - `imagePullSecrets.username` and `imagePullSecrets.password`
# - `env.proxyConfig`
# - `central.defaultTLS`
#
# If you do choose to use this file (either by manually filling in values, or by
# generating it via the `roxctl central generate` command family), you must store
# it in a safe and secure place, such as a secrets management system.
#

# # BEGIN CONFIGURATION VALUES SECTION

# # Image pull credentials. If you do not specify these, you need to specify one of
# # the following:
# # - `imagePullSecrets.allowNone=true`: in case your registry allows pulling images without
# #   credentials.
# # - `imagePullSecrets.useExisting="secret1;secret2;..."`: in case you have pre-existing image
# #   pull secrets with the given name already created in the target namespace.
# # - `imagePullSecrets.useFromDefaultServiceAccount=true`: in case the default service account
# #   in the target namespace is configured with sufficiently scoped image pull secrets.
# # If you do not know if any of the above applies to your situation, your best course of
# # action is probably to enter your image pull credentials here.
# imagePullSecrets:
#   username: <StackRox image pull user>
#   password: <StackRox image pull password>
#
# # Proxy configuration. This will only be required if you are running in an environment
# # where internet access is not possible by default.
# # Since this configuration may contain a proxy password, it is treated as a sensitive
# # piece of configuration.
# # The following example is a stripped-down one. For a full documentation, see the file
# # `config/proxy-config.yaml.default` that is shipped with this chart.
# env:
#   proxyConfig: |
#     url: http://proxy.name:port

#
# # TLS Certificate Configuration.
# # Most of the following values are not typically required to be populated manually. You can
# # either omit them, in which case they will be auto-generated upon initial installation,
# # or they are populated when you invoke `roxctl central generate` to generate deployment
# # files.

# # by StackRox services.
