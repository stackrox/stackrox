## StackRox Central chart default settings file.
##
## This file includes the default settings for the StackRox Central chart.
## It serves as a form of documentation for all the possible settings that a
## user can override are. HOWEVER, if you want to override some settings, DO NOT
## create a copy of this file to be used as a baseline, or modify it in place.
## Instead, create a file that contains only those settings you want to override,
## and pass it to helm or roxctl via the `-f` parameter.
##
## For example, if you want to disable the deployment of scanner, create a file
## `values-override.yaml` (or any name you choose) with the following contents:
##
##  scanner:
##    disable: true
##
## and then invoke helm by passing `-f values-override.yaml` to
## `helm install`/`helm upgrade`.
##
## Alternatively, if you want to override just a few values, you can set them directly
## via the `--set` command, e.g.,
##  $ helm install --set scanner.disable=true ...
##
## Note that an arbitrary number of `-f` and `--set` parameters can be combined. It is
## generally a good practice to store secret data such as the admin password separate from
## non-sensitive configuration data.
##
#
## Configuration for image pull secrets.
## These should usually be set via the command line when running `helm install`, e.g.,
## helm install --set imagePullSecrets.username=myuser --set imagePullSecrets.password=mypass,
## or be stored in a separate YAML-encoded secrets file.
#imagePullSecrets:
#  # Username and password to be used for pulling images.
#  # These should usually be set via the command line when running `helm install`, e.g.,
#  # helm install --set imagePullSecrets.username=myuser --set imagePullSecrets.password=mypass,
#  # or be stored in a separate YAML-encoded secrets file.
#  username: null
#  password: null
#
#  # If no image pull secrets are provided, an installation would usually fail. In order to
#  # prevent it from failing, this option must explicitly be set to true.
#  allowNone: false
#
#  # If there exist available image pull secrets in the cluster that are managed separately,
#  # set this value to the list of the respective secret names. While it is recommended to
#  # record the secret names in a persisted YAML file, providing a single string containing
#  # a comma-delimited list of secret names is also supported, for easier interaction with
#  # --set.
#  useExisting: []
#
#  # Whether to import any secrets from the default service account existing in the StackRox
#  # namespace. The default service account often contains "standard" image pull secrets that
#  # should be used by default for image pulls, hence this defaults to true. Only has an effect
#  # if server-side lookups are enabled.
#  useFromDefaultServiceAccount: true
#
## Common settings for all image properties
#image:
#  # The image registry to use. Unless overridden in the more specific configs, this
#  # determines the base registry for each image referenced in this config file.
#  registry: stackrox.io
#
## Settings regarding the installation environment
#env:
#  # Treat the environment as an OpenShift cluster. Leave this unset to use auto-detection
#  # based on available API resources on the server.
#  # Possible values: null, false, true, 3, 4
#  openshift: null
#
#  # Treat the environment as Istio-enabled. Leave this unset to use auto-detection based on
#  # available API resources on the server.
#  # Possible values: null, false, true
#  istio: null
#
#  # The cloud provider platform where the target Kubernetes cluster is running. Leave this
#  # unset to use auto-detection based on the Kubernetes version.
#  # Possible values: null, "default", "gke"
#  platform: null
#
#  # Whether to run StackRox in offline mode. When run in offline mode, no connections to external
#  # endpoints will be made.
#  offlineMode: false
#
#  # The proxy configuration for Central and Scanner, specified either as an embedded YAML
#  # directionary, or as an (expandable) string.
#  proxyConfig: null
#
#
## Settings for the StackRox Service CA certificates.
## If `cert` and `key` are both set (it is an error to set only one of the two), the corresponding
## values are used as the PEM-encoded certificate and private key for the internal Service CA.
## If they are left unspecified, they are generated under the following conditions:
## - `generate` is explicitly set to true, or
## - `generate` is unset (null), and the Helm chart is being freshly installed (as opposed to being
##    upgraded).
#ca:
#  cert: null
#  key: null
#  generate: null
#

## Additional CA certificates to trust, besides system roots
## If specified, this should be a map mapping file names to PEM-encoded contents.
