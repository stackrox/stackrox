# StackRox Kubernetes Security Platform - Secured Cluster Services Helm Chart

This Helm chart allows you to deploy the necessary services on a StackRox
secured cluster: StackRox Sensor, StackRox Collector, and StackRox Admission
Control.
If you want to install Secured Cluster Services for Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security,
refer to [Installing the secured-cluster-services Helm chart](https://docs.openshift.com/acs/installing/installing_helm/install-helm-quick.html#installing-secured-cluster-services-quickly_acs-install-helm-quick).

## Prerequisites

To deploy the secured cluster services for the StackRox Kubernetes Security Platform, you must:
- Have at least version 3.1 of the Helm tool installed on your machine

> **IMPORTANT**
>
> We publish new Helm charts with every new release of the StackRox Kubernetes
> Security Platform. Make sure to use a version of this chart that matches the
> StackRox Kubernetes Security Platform version you have installed.

## Add the canonical chart location as a Helm repository

The canonical repository for StackRox Helm charts is [< required "" .ChartRepo.URL >].
To use StackRox Helm charts, run the following command:
```sh
helm repo add stackrox [< required "" .ChartRepo.URL >]
```
Only run this command once per machine on which you want to use StackRox Helm
charts.

Before you deploy or upgrade a chart from a remote repository, you must
run the following command:
```sh
helm repo update
```

## Install Secured Cluster Services

Installing a new StackRox secured cluster requires a *cluster init bundle*. You
can generate a **cluster init bundle** by using the `roxctl` CLI or the StackRox
portal. You can use the same bundle to set up multiple StackRox secured
clusters by providing it as an input to the `helm install` command.

> **NOTE**:
>
> - The following sections assume that you have a safe way to pass secrets to
>   the helm command.
> - If not, you can decouple secret creation from installing or upgrading the
>   Helm chart, see [Deployment with pre-created secrets](#deployment-with-pre-created-secrets) for more information.

### Generate cluster init bundle

Run the following command to generate a **cluster init bundle**:
```sh
roxctl central init-bundles generate <cluster init bundle name> --output cluster-init-bundle.yaml
```

- This command creates a **cluster init bundle** called
  `cluster-init-bundle.yaml`.
- Make sure that you store this bundle securely as it contains secrets. You can
  use the same bundle to set up multiple StackRox secured clusters.

### Deploy Secured Cluster Services

You can use the following command to deploy secured cluster services by using
this Helm chart:
```sh
helm install -n stackrox --create-namespace \
    stackrox-secured-cluster-services stackrox/stackrox-secured-cluster-services \
    -f <path to cluster-init-bundle.yaml> \
    --set clusterName=<name of the secured cluster> \
    --set centralEndpoint=<endpoint of Central service>
```
- In this command, you can replace the chart name
  `stackrox/stackrox-secured-cluster-services` with the chart's file path if you have it
  locally.
- The provided cluster name can either denote the intended name for a new secured cluster
  or the name of an existing cluster, in which case the name will be reused and associated
  with the Kubernetes cluster on which the chart is installed.

After you deploy the StackRox Kubernetes Security Platform Secured Cluster
Services using the `helm install` command, you will see informative notes and
warnings related to the installation. The new cluster automatically registers
itself to StackRox Central, and it is visible in the StackRox portal as a
Helm-managed cluster. If the provided cluster name is already associated with
an existing secured cluster, the name will be reused and associated with the
cluster on which the chart is installed.

In case you use image mirroring or otherwise access StackRox container images from non-standard location,
you may also need to provide image pull credentials.
There are several ways to inject the required credentials (if any) into the installation process:

- **Explicitly specify username and password:** Use this if you are using a registry that supports username/password
  authentication. Pass the following arguments to the `helm install` command:
  ```sh
  --set imagePullSecrets.username=<registry username> --set imagePullSecrets.password=<registry password>
  ```
- **Use pre-existing image pull secrets:** If you already have one or several image pull secrets
  created in the namespace to which you are deploying, you can reference these in the following
  way (we assume that your secrets are called `pull-secret-1` and `pull-secret-2`):
  ```sh
  --set imagePullSecrets.useExisting="pull-secret-1;pull-secret-2"
  ```
- **Do not use image pull secrets:** If you are pulling your images from quay.io/stackrox-io or a registry in a private
  network that does not require authentication, or if the default service account in the namespace
  to which you are deploying is already configured with appropriate image pull secrets, you do
  not need to specify any additional image pull secrets.

### Applying custom configuration options

The secured cluster services Helm chart has many different configuration
options. You can directly specify these options when you run the `helm install`
command for simple use cases.

However, we recommend storing your configuration in a file and using that file
for future upgrades or reconfiguration using the `helm upgrade` command.

#### Specifying options with `--set` parameter

You can use the `--set` and `--set-file` parameter with the `helm install`
command to specify various options to customize deployments quickly. However,
don't use them for specifying complex configurations.

For example,
- **Configure cluster environment**:
  ```sh
  --set env.openshift=true
  ```
- **Configure collection method**:
  ```sh
  --set collector.collectionMethod=EBPF
  ```

#### Using configuration YAML files and the `-f` command-line option

We recommended that you store all custom configuration options in persisted files.

The Secured Cluster Services Helm chart contains example configuration files
(called `values-public.yaml.example` and `values-private.yaml.example`), that list
all the available configuration options, along with documentation.

The following sample configuration file (`secured-cluster.yaml`) uses a few of
the options which you can configure:
- **`values-public.yaml`:**
  ```yaml
  clusterName: "acme-cluster-01"
  centralEndpoint: "central.acme-labs.internal"

  env:
    istio: true  # enable istio support

  sensor:
    # Use custom resource overrides for sensor
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: "2"
        memory: "4Gi"
      limits:
        cpu: "4"
        memory: "8Gi"

  admissionControl:
    dynamic:
      disableBypass: true # Disable bypassing of Admission Controller

  customize:
    # Apply the important-service=true label for all objects managed by this chart.
    labels:
      important-service: true
    # Set the CLUSTER=important-cluster environment variable for all containers in the
    # collector deployment:
    collector:
      envVars:
        CLUSTER: important-cluster
  ```
- **`values-private.yaml`**:
  ```yaml
  imagePullSecrets:
    username: <username for StackRox image registry>
    password: <password for StackRox image registry>
  ```

After you have created these YAML files, you can inject the configuration options into the
installation process via the `-f` flag, i.e., by appending the following options to the
`helm install` invocation:
```sh
helm install ... -f values-public.yaml -f values-private.yaml
```

#### Changing configuration options after deployment

To make changes to the configuration of an existing deployment of the StackRox
Secured Cluster Services:
1. Change the configuration options in your YAML configuration file(s).
1. Use the `-f` option and specify the configuration file's path when you
   run the `helm upgrade` command.

For example, to apply configuration changes for the secured cluster, use the following command:
```sh
helm upgrade -n stackrox \
    stackrox-secured-cluster-services stackrox/stackrox-secured-cluster-services \
    --reuse-values \
    -f values-public.yaml \
    -f values-private.yaml
```

You can also specify configuration values using the `--set` or `--set-file`
parameters. However, these options aren't saved, and you'll have to specify all
the options again manually.

#### Changing cluster name after deployment

To change the name of the cluster shown in the StackRox portal, you must specify
values for both the `--clusterName` and the `--confirmNewClusterName` options:

```sh
helm upgrade -n stackrox stackrox-secured-cluster-services --clusterName=<new-cluster-name> --confirmNewClusterName=<new-cluster-name>
```

> **NOTE:**
>
> When you change the cluster name:
> - The StackRox Kubernetes Security Platform either creates a new cluster or
>   reuses an existing cluster if a cluster with the same name already exists.
> - The StackRox Kubernetes Security Platform doesn't rename the old cluster.
>   The old cluster still shows up in the StackRox portal, but it doesn't
>   receive any data. You must remove the old cluster if you don't want to see
>   it in the StackRox portal.

### Configuration

The following table lists some common configuration parameters of this Helm
chart and their default values:

|Parameter |Description | Default value |
|:---------|:-----------|:--------------|
|`clusterName`| Name of your cluster. | |
|`confirmNewClusterName`| You don't need to change this unless you upgrade and change the value for `clusterName`. In this case, set it to the new value of `clusterName`. This option exists to prevent you from [accidentally creating a new cluster with a different name](#changing-cluster-after-deployment). | `null` |
|`centralEndpoint`| Address of the Central endpoint, including the port number (without a trailing slash). If you are using a non-gRPC capable LoadBalancer, use the WebSocket protocol by prefixing the endpoint address with `wss://`. |`central.stackrox.svc:443` |
|`clusterLabels`| Custom labels associated with a secured cluster | `{}` |
|`additionalCAs`| Use it to add (named) PEM-encoded CA certificates for Sensor. | `{}` |
|`imagePullSecrets.username`| Specify username for accessing image registry. |`null`|
|`imagePullSecrets.password`| Specify password for accessing image registry. |`null`|
|`imagePullSecrets.useExisting`| Specify existing Kubernetes image pull secrets that should be used for trying to pull StackRox images. |`[]`|
|`imagePullSecrets.useFromDefaultServiceAccount`| This setting controls whether image pull secrets from a default service account in the target namespace should be used for image pulls. |`true`|
|`imagePullSecrets.allowNone`| Enabling this setting indicates that no image pull secrets are required to be configured upon initial deployment. Use this setting if you are using a cluster-private registry that does not require authentication. |`false`|
|`image.main.name`|Repository from which to download the main image. |`main` |
|`image.collector.name`|Repository from which to download the collector image.  |`collector` |
|`image.main.registry`| Address of the registry you are using for main image.|`[< required "" .MainRegistry >]` |
|`image.collector.registry`| Address of the registry you are using for collector image.|`[< required "" .CollectorRegistry >]` |
|`sensor.endpoint`| Address of the Sensor endpoint including port number. No trailing slash.|`sensor.stackrox.svc:443` |
|`collector.collectionMethod`|Either `EBPF`, `CORE_BPF`, or `NO_COLLECTION`. |`EBPF` |
|`collector.disableTaintTolerations`|If you specify `false`, tolerations are applied to collector, and the collector pods can schedule onto all nodes with taints. If you specify it as `true`, no tolerations are applied, and the collector pods won't scheduled onto nodes with taints. |`false` |
|`collector.slimMode`| Specify `true` if you want to use a slim Collector image for deploying Collector. Using slim Collector images requires Central to provide the matching kernel module or eBPF probe. If you are running the StackRox Kubernetes Security Platform in offline mode, you must download a kernel support package from [stackrox.io](https://install.stackrox.io/collector/support-packages/index.html) and upload it to Central for slim Collectors to function. Otherwise, you must ensure that Central can access the online probe repository hosted at https://collector-modules.stackrox.io/.|`false` |
|`admissionControl.listenOnCreates`| This setting controls whether the cluster is configured to contact the StackRox Kubernetes Security Platform with `AdmissionReview` requests for `create` events on Kubernetes objects. |`false` |
|`admissionControl.listenOnUpdates`|This setting controls whether the cluster is configured to contact the StackRox Kubernetes Security Platform with `AdmissionReview` requests for `update` events on Kubernetes objects.|`false` |
|`admissionControl.listenOnEvents`|This setting controls whether the cluster is configured to contact the StackRox Kubernetes Security Platform with `AdmissionReview` requests for `update` Kubernetes events like `exec` and `portforward`.|`false` on OpenShift, `true` otherwise.|
|`admissionControl.dynamic.enforceOnCreates`| It controls whether the StackRox Kubernetes Security Platform evaluates policies; if it’s disabled, all `AdmissionReview` requests are automatically accepted. You must specify `listenOnCreates` as `true` for this to work. |`false` |
|`admissionControl.dynamic.enforceOnUpdates`| It controls whether the StackRox Kubernetes Security Platform evaluates policies for object updates; if it’s disabled, all `AdmissionReview` requests are automatically accepted. You must specify `listenOnUpdates` as `true` for this to work. |`false`|
|`admissionControl.dynamic.scanInline`| |`false` |
|`admissionControl.dynamic.disableBypass`|Set it to `true` to disable [bypassing the admission controller](https://help.stackrox.com/docs/manage-security-policies/use-admission-controller-enforcement/). |`false` |
|`admissionControl.dynamic.timeout`|The maximum time in seconds, the StackRox Kubernetes Security Platform should wait while evaluating admission review requests. Use it to set request timeouts when you enable image scanning. If the image scan runs longer than the specified time, the StackRox Kubernetes Security Platform accepts the request. Other enforcement options, such as scaling the deployment to zero replicas, are still applied later if the image violates applicable policies.|`3` |
|`registryOverride`|Use this parameter to override the default `docker.io` registry. Specify the name of your registry if you are using some other registry.| |
|`createUpgraderServiceAccount`| Specify `true` to create the `sensor-upgrader` account. By default, the StackRox Kubernetes Security Platform creates a service account called `sensor-upgrader` in each secured cluster. This account is highly privileged but is only used during upgrades. If you don’t create this account, you will have to complete future upgrades manually if the Sensor doesn’t have enough permissions. See [Enable automatic upgrades for secured clusters](https://help.stackrox.com/docs/configure-stackrox/enable-automatic-upgrades/) for more information.|`false` |
|`createSecrets`| Specify `false` to skip the orchestrator secret creation for the sensor, collector, and admission controller. | `true` |
|`customize`|Modern interface for specifying custom metadata for resources, including labels, annotations and environment variables. See below for more information.|`{}`|
[</*
ROX-8778: workaround for single customer. These options are not publicly documented, and are not supported by our CRDs.
|collector.disableSELinuxOptions|Set it to `true` to disable all SELinux options for the security context of Collector's Compliance container|`null`|
|collector.seLinuxOptionsType| Value for `type` in the SELinux options for the security context of Collector's Compliance container. This has no effect if `collector.disableSELinuxOptions` is set to `true`. `|`container_runtime_t`|
 */>]

The following table lists some advanced parameters, and you'll only need them in
non-standard environments:

|Parameter |Description | Default value |
|:---------|:-----------|:--------------|
|`image.main.tag`| Tag of `main` image to use.|`null` |
|`image.collector.tag`| Tag of `collector` image to use.| `null` |
|`image.main.pullPolicy`| Image pull policy for `main` images.|`IfNotPresent`|

|`admissionControl.nodeSelector` | Node selector for Admission Control pods placement. | `null` (no placement constraints) |
|`exposeMonitoring`| This setting controls whether the monitoring port (TCP 9090) should be exposed on the services. | `false` |
|`env.openshift`| The StackRox Kubernetes Security Platform automatically detects the OpenShift version (`3.x` or `4.x`). Use this parameter to override the automatically detected version number, for example `4`. | `null` |
|`env.istio`| This setting can be used for overwriting the auto-sensing of Istio environments. If enabled, the cluster is set up for an Istio environment. | Auto-sensed, depends on environment. |
|`scanner.disable`| Scan images stored in the cluster's local registries. This variable is only available for the OpenShift Container Platform. | `true` |

### Default resources

Each container's default resource settings are defined in the
`internal/defaults.yaml` file in this chart. The following table lists the YAML
paths to the respective defaults for each container that this chart deploys:

|Container        |Path in `internal/defaults.yaml`           |
|:----------------|:------------------------------------------|
|Sensor           |`defaults.sensor.resources`                |
|Collector        |`defaults.collector.resources`             |
|Compliance       |`defaults.collector.complianceResources`   |
|NodeInventory    |`defaults.collector.nodeScanningResources`|
|Admission Control|`defaults.admissionControl.resources`      |

### Customization settings

The `customize` setting allows specifying custom Kubernetes metadata (labels and
annotations) for all objects created by this Helm chart and additional pod
labels, pod annotations, and container environment variables for workloads.

The configuration is hierarchical, in the sense that metadata defined at a more
generic scope (for example, for all objects) can be overridden by metadata
defined at a narrower scope (for example, only for the sensor deployment).

For example:

```
customize:
  # Extra metadata for all objects.
  labels:
    my-label-key: my-label-value
  annotations:
    my-annotation-key: my-annotation-value
  # Extra pod metadata for all objects (only has an effect for workloads, i.e., deployments and daemonsets).
  podLabels:
    my-pod-label-key: my-pod-label-value
  podAnnotations:
    my-pod-annotation-key: my-pod-annotation-value
  # Extra environment variables for all containers in all workloads.
  envVars:
    MY_ENV_VAR_NAME: MY_ENV_VAR_VALUE
  # Extra metadata for the central deployment only.
  sensor:
    labels: {}
    annotations: {}
    podLabels: {}
    podAnnotations: {}
    envVars: {}
  # Extra metadata for the collector deployment only.
  collector:
    labels: {}
    annotations: {}
    podLabels: {}
    podAnnotations: {}
    envVars: {}
  # Extra metadata for the admission-control deployment only.
  admission-control:
    labels: {}
    annotations: {}
    podLabels: {}
    podAnnotations: {}
    envVars: {}
  # Extra metadata for all other objects. The keys in the following map can be
  # an object name of the form "service/sensor", or a reference to all
  # objects of a given type in the form "service/*". The values under each key
  # are the five metadata overrides (labels, annotations, podLabels, podAnnotations, envVars)
  # as specified above, though only the first two will be relevant for non-workload
  # object types.
  other:
    "service/*":
      labels: {}
      annotations: {}
```

## Deployment with pre-created secrets

The init bundle that you pass to the `helm` command using the `-f` flag creates
Kubernetes secrets for TLS certificates. If you don't want Helm to manage your
Kubernetes secrets, you can deploy the Secured Cluster Services chart without
creating secrets. However, it requires that you always specify the StackRox CA
certificate while installing or upgrading the Helm chart. This certificate
doesn't need to be kept secret.

1. **Obtain the CA certificate configuration** either through the StackRox
   portal or by using the `roxctl` CLI.
   - **StackRox portal**:
     1. Navigate to **Platform Configuration** > **Integrations**.
     1. Under the **Authentication Tokens** section, select **Cluster Init Bundle**.
     1. Select **Get CA Config** on the top right to download the configuration
        file called `ca-config.yaml`.
   - **`roxctl CLI**:
     1. Run the following command:
        ```sh
        roxctl central init-bundles fetch-ca --output ca-config.yaml
        ```
        This command writes the CA certificate configuration in a file called
        `ca-config.yaml`.
1. **Use the CA certificate configuration in your Helm installation**. When you
   run the `helm install` or the `helm upgrade` command,
   pass the option `-f ca-config.yaml`:
   ```sh
   helm install -n stackrox stackrox-secured-cluster-services stackrox/stackrox-secured-cluster-services \
     -f ca-config.yaml \
     <other options ...>
   ```
1. **Disable TLS secret creation**. To prevent Helm from creating Kubernetes
   secrets for the StackRox service certificates, set the `createSecrets` option
   to `false`. You can either specify `createSecrets` option in a YAML
   configuration file (such as `values-public.yaml`) or pass it to the `helm`
   command by adding the `--set createSecrets=false` option.

### Required Kubernetes secrets

The following list contains the Kubernetes `Secret` objects that you need to
create in the `stackrox` namespace (or the custom namespace you are using) if
you configure the Helm chart to not create TLS certificate secrets.

- `sensor-tls` with data:
  - `ca.pem`: PEM-encoded StackRox CA certificate
  - `sensor-cert.pem`: PEM-encoded StackRox Sensor certificate
  - `sensor-key.pem`: PEM-encoded private key for the StackRox Sensor certificate
- `collector-tls` with data:
  - `ca.pem`: PEM-encoded StackRox CA certificate
  - `collector-cert.pem`: PEM-encoded StackRox Collector certificate
  - `collector-key.pem`: PEM-encoded private key for the StackRox Collector certificate
- `admission-control-tls` with data:
  - `ca.pem`: PEM-encoded StackRox CA certificate
  - `admission-control-cert.pem`: PEM-encoded StackRox Admission Control certificate
  - `admission-control-key.pem`: PEM-encoded private key for the StackRox Admision Control certificate

#### Obtaining secrets for an existing cluster

If you upgrade from a previous Helm chart, you can create certificates specific
to a particular cluster by using the following `roxctl` CLI command:

```sh
export ROX_API_TOKEN=<StackRox API token>
roxctl -e <central endpoint and port> sensor generate-certs <cluster name>
```
Running this command create a file called `cluster-<cluster-name>-tls.yaml` in
the current directory. The file contains YAML manifests for the
[required Kubernetes secrets](#required-kubernetes-secrets).

#### Obtaining secrets for an init bundle

If you want to deploy multiple clusters using this Helm chart and want to create
certificates that can be used to register new clusters on-the-fly, you can
obtain the contents of an init bundle in the form of Kubernetes secrets. You can
use the StackRox portal or the `roxctl` CLI for this.

- **Using the StackRox portal**:
  1. Navigate to **Platform Configuration** > **Integrations**.
  1. Under the **Authentication Tokens** section, select **Cluster Init Bundle**.
  1. Select the add **+** icon on the top left and enter a name for the new init
     bundle.
  1. Select **Generate**.
  1. Select **Download Kubernetes Secrets File** at the bottom to save the
     Kubernetes manifests to a file called
     `<init-bundle-name>-cluster-init-secrets.yaml`.
- **Using the `roxctl` CLI**:
  1. run the following command:
  ```sh
  roxctl central init-bundles generate <name> --output-secrets cluster-init-secrets.yaml
  ```
  This command stores the Kubernetes secret manifests for the cluster init
  certificates in a file called `cluster-init-secrets.yaml`.

You can then use the YAML file to generate secrets through any method that you like, for example, using Sealed Secrets.

> **NOTE**
>
> Even when you use the certificates from an init bundle, you still need to
> specify the CA certificate configuration every time you install or upgrade the
> Helm chart.
