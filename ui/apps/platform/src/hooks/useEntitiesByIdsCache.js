 * React Hook, similar to `useState`, which expects the value to be an array of immutable entities with unique IDs.

 * all those entities are already present in the current value. Entities are compared by ID attribute, therefore
 * it's expected that entities are not mutable (same ID means they're deep equal) and there are no duplicate IDs.
 *
 * @param {Object[]} [initialState=[]] cache will be initialized with this value (similar to `useState`)
 * @param {Object} [options] cache options
 * @param {string} [options.idAttribute=id] attribute name to use to compare entities
 * @param {boolean}[options.respectOrder=true] in case order of IDs is different from cached value, consider it an update
 * @return {[Object[], Function]} Returns a stateful value, and a function to update it (similar to `useState`)
