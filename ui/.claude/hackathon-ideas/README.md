# StackRox AI Hackathon Ideas

A collection of AI-powered project ideas for StackRox hackathons and innovation days.

## Adding New Ideas

When documenting a new hackathon idea, create a markdown file with:

1. **Overview** - What problem does it solve?
2. **How It Works** - Technical approach
3. **Implementation Plan** - Step-by-step breakdown
4. **Success Metrics** - How to measure success
5. **Scope** - What's realistic for a hackathon
6. **Future Potential** - Could this become a real feature?

Then add an entry to this README.
