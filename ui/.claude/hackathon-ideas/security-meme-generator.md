# Security Meme Generator

**Status:** Idea
**Estimated Effort:** 1 day hackathon project
**Category:** Wildcard / Security Culture

## Overview

Transform dry security violations, CVEs, and compliance failures into shareable, humorous memes. The goal is to make security awareness more engaging while still communicating real risks.

## The Problem

- Security alerts are boring and often ignored
- Teams become desensitized to violation notifications
- Security culture needs to be engaging, not just punitive
- Important security information doesn't stick in people's minds

## The Solution

An AI-powered meme generator that takes real security data from StackRox and creates funny, shareable memes that communicate security issues in an engaging way.

---

## How It Works

### Input Sources

1. **Live Violation Data from StackRox**
   - Policy violations (e.g., "Privileged container detected")
   - Runtime incidents
   - Compliance failures
   - Image vulnerabilities

2. **CVE Information**
   - Severity levels
   - Affected packages
   - CVSS scores
   - Vulnerability types (RCE, privilege escalation, etc.)

3. **Custom User Input**
   - Describe a security scenario
   - Pick from common violation types
   - Free-form security humor requests

### AI Processing Pipeline

The AI would:

1. **Understand the context**
   - Is this a critical CVE or a minor config issue?
   - Is this a repeated violation?
   - What's the severity and impact?

2. **Choose appropriate tone**
   - Critical issues → "oh no" vibes
   - Repeated violations → "not again" energy
   - Config mistakes → educational humor

3. **Select meme template**
   - Match violation type to appropriate meme format
   - Consider severity when choosing tone

4. **Generate witty text**
   - Create overlays that are funny AND accurate
   - Include enough context to be educational
   - Balance humor with seriousness of issue

### Output Options

#### Option A: Template-Based (Recommended for Hackathon)
- Use existing meme templates via APIs like imgflip
- AI generates witty text overlays
- Quick, predictable, reliable
- **Best for 1-day scope**

#### Option B: AI Image Generation (More Ambitious)
- Use DALL-E/Stable Diffusion
- More creative freedom
- Harder to nail humor consistently
- May be too slow/unreliable

#### Option C: Hybrid Approach
- Curated templates + AI text generation
- Best of both worlds
- Could be good stretch goal

## Example Memes

### Example 1: Root Privilege Violation

**Input:**
```
Deployment 'payment-service' running as root with 12 critical CVEs
```

**Output:**
```
[Distracted Boyfriend meme]
Boyfriend label: "DevOps Team"
Girlfriend label: "Least Privilege Principle"
Other woman label: "chmod 777 everything"
```

### Example 2: Log4j CVE (Again)

**Input:**
```
CVE-2024-1234: Critical RCE in log4j (CVSS 9.8)
```

**Output:**
```
[This Is Fine dog meme]
Text overlay: "We updated log4j in 2021"
Subtitle: "CVE-2024-1234: 9.8 CVSS - Critical RCE"
```

### Example 3: Admission Controller Bypass

**Input:**
```
Multiple deployments failing admission control checks
```

**Output:**
```
[Drake No/Yes meme]
Drake No: "Reading admission controller docs"
Drake Yes: "Disabling admission controller in prod"
Bottom text: "DON'T BE THIS DEVELOPER"
```

### Example 4: Unpatched Vulnerabilities

**Input:**
```
47 critical vulnerabilities detected in production
```

**Output:**
```
[Expanding Brain meme]
Level 1: "Patch vulnerabilities immediately"
Level 2: "Schedule patches for next sprint"
Level 3: "Add to backlog"
Level 4: "Vulnerabilities are just features"
Caption: "Security maturity levels (please be level 1)"
```

- Have fallback "safe" mode with educational focus
- Allow manual editing of generated text

### Risk 2: AI Generates Inappropriate Content
**Mitigation:**
- Careful prompt engineering
- Content filters/validation
- Manual review before sharing
- Whitelist of acceptable templates

### Risk 3: Trivializes Serious Issues
**Mitigation:**
- Severity-aware tone adjustment
- Option to disable for critical CVEs
- Include actual remediation info alongside meme
- Make it educational, not just funny

### Risk 4: Limited Template Variety
**Mitigation:**
- Start with proven, versatile templates
- Focus on quality over quantity
- Community can suggest new templates
