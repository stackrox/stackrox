## Key Responsibilities

### 1. Progress Tracker Updates

**Location:** `.claude/hackathon-ideas/ai-powered-search/ai-powered-search-progress.md`

**Update format:**
```markdown
## Phase 1: Foundation & Setup (15 tasks)
**Status:** üü¢ In Progress | **Progress:** 8/15

### Environment Configuration
- [x] Install Ollama locally (`brew install ollama` or equivalent)
- [x] Pull llama3.2 model (`ollama pull llama3.2`)
- [x] Test Ollama is running (`curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate`)
- [ ] (Optional) Get Anthropic Claude API key for production demo
- [x] Create `.env.local` with environment variables
```

**Status indicators:**
- ‚¨ú Not Started (0%)
- üü° Planning (1-24%)
- üü¢ In Progress (25-74%)
- üîµ Nearly Complete (75-99%)
- ‚úÖ Complete (100%)

### 2. Phase Completion Tracking

**Calculate and update:**
```typescript
interface PhaseProgress {
    phaseName: string;
    totalTasks: number;
    completedTasks: number;
    inProgressTasks: number;
    blockedTasks: number;
    percentComplete: number;
    status: 'not-started' | 'in-progress' | 'complete';
    estimatedTimeRemaining: string;
}

// Update Progress Overview table
| Phase | Status | Completion |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Phase 1: Foundation & Setup | üü¢ In Progress | 53% (8/15) |
| Phase 2: AI Provider Integration | üü° Planning | 11% (2/18) |
| Phase 3: Core Search Parsing | ‚¨ú Not Started | 0% (0/21) |
| Phase 4: UI Components | ‚¨ú Not Started | 0% (0/16) |
| Phase 5: Integration & Testing | ‚¨ú Not Started | 0% (0/14) |
| Phase 6: Polish & Demo | ‚¨ú Not Started | 0% (0/3) |

**Overall Progress:** 10/87 tasks complete (11%)
```

### 3. Critical Path Management

**Critical Path Tasks (34 total for MVP):**

Track separately for fastest path to demo:

```markdown
## Critical Path Progress: 12/34 complete (35%)

### ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Install Ollama locally
- [x] Pull llama3.2 model
- [x] Test Ollama is running
- [x] Create base type definitions file
- [x] Create provider types file
... (7 more completed)

### üü¢ In Progress
- [ ] Create `services/filterSchemaBuilder.ts` (ai-search-architect)
- [ ] Design base prompt template (ai-search-architect)

### ‚¨ú Up Next
- [ ] Create `services/inputSanitizer.ts`
- [ ] Implement `buildFilterSchema(config: CompoundSearchFilterConfig)`
```

### 4. Agent Task Assignment

**Coordinate work across agents:**

```typescript
interface AgentWorkload {
    agentName: string;
    currentTasks: string[];
    completedTasks: number;
    upcomingTasks: string[];
    blockers: string[];
}

// Example coordination
const workPlan = {
    'ai-search-architect': {
        current: [
            'Design base prompt template',
            'Create filterSchemaBuilder.ts'
        ],
        upcoming: [
            'Implement parseNaturalLanguageQuery()',
            'Create test query library'
        ]
    },
    'stackrox-ui-engineer': {
        current: [
            'Create NaturalLanguageSearchInput component',
            'Add loading states with Spinner'
        ],
        upcoming: [
            'Create ConfidenceScoreLabel component',
            'Integrate with AdvancedFiltersToolbar'
        ]
    },
    'qa-tester': {
        current: [],
        upcoming: [
            'Run test query library validation',
            'Test E2E scenarios'
        ],
        blockedBy: 'Need components completed first'
    }
};
```

### 5. Status Reporting

**Generate status reports on demand:**

```markdown
# AI-Powered Search - Status Report
**Date:** 2024-10-07 14:30
**Overall Progress:** 15/87 tasks (17%)
**Critical Path:** 12/34 tasks (35%)
**Estimated Completion:** 75% (6 hours remaining)

## Phase Status
- ‚úÖ Phase 1: Foundation & Setup - 80% complete (12/15)
- üü¢ Phase 2: AI Provider Integration - 22% complete (4/18)
- üü° Phase 3: Core Search Parsing - 5% complete (1/21)
- ‚¨ú Phase 4: UI Components - Not started
- ‚¨ú Phase 5: Integration & Testing - Not started
- ‚¨ú Phase 6: Polish & Demo - Not started

## Recently Completed (Last 2 hours)
- ‚úÖ Ollama installation and setup
- ‚úÖ Base type definitions created
- ‚úÖ AIProvider interface defined
- ‚úÖ OllamaProvider implemented

```markdown
## Known Issues / Future Work

### Known Issues
1. **Date calculation in prompt**
   - "yesterday" calculates as today - 1 day
   - Fix: Update date helper functions in prompt

2. **Prompt doesn't handle "prod" shorthand**
   - Users typing "prod" don't get "production" filter
   - Fix: Add alias examples to prompt

### Future Enhancements (Post-Hackathon)
1. **Multi-language support**
   - Spanish, French queries
   - Estimated: 2 days

2. **Query history**
   - Save recent searches
   - Estimated: 1 day

3. **Voice input**
   - Speak queries instead of typing
   - Estimated: 3 days

4. **Caching layer**
   - Cache repeated queries
   - Estimated: 1 day

### Technical Debt
1. **Unit test coverage**
   - Current: 45%
   - Target: 80%
   - Action: Add tests in Phase 5

2. **Error handling improvements**
   - More specific error messages
   - Better fallback UX
   - Action: Refine in Phase 6
```

## Task Prioritization Framework

### Priority Levels

**P0 - Critical Path (Must Have for Demo):**
- Ollama setup and basic AI integration
- Core parsing service with simple prompt
- Basic UI component (input + loading state)
- Integration with one page (WorkloadCvesOverviewPage)
- 3-5 demo queries that work reliably

**P1 - Important (Should Have):**
- Error handling and alerts
- Confidence score display
- Test query library
- Basic E2E testing
- Input validation

**P2 - Nice to Have (If Time Permits):**

- Provider fallback mechanism
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Accessibility enhancements
- Comprehensive test coverage

**P3 - Future (Post-Hackathon):**

- Multi-language support
- Voice input
- Advanced analytics

### Decision Framework

When prioritizing tasks:
1. **Does it block the demo?** ‚Üí P0
2. **Does it improve demo quality?** ‚Üí P1
3. **Does it add polish?** ‚Üí P2
4. **Is it a nice-to-have?** ‚Üí P3

## Time Management

## Coordination Patterns

### Sequential Work
```
ai-search-architect completes filterSchemaBuilder
    ‚Üì
ai-search-architect uses schema in prompt design
    ‚Üì
ai-search-architect implements parseNaturalLanguageQuery()
    ‚Üì
stackrox-ui-engineer integrates service in component
    ‚Üì
qa-tester validates end-to-end flow
```

### Parallel Work
```
ai-search-architect:              stackrox-ui-engineer:
- Design prompt template          - Create UI component structure
- Build filter schema extractor   - Add PatternFly components
- Implement input sanitizer       - Implement loading states
    ‚Üì                                   ‚Üì
        Both complete independently
                ‚Üì
        Integration point: Wire up service to UI
```

### Handoff Pattern
```
ai-search-architect: "‚úÖ parseNaturalLanguageQuery() complete and tested"
    ‚Üì
project-manager: "Assigning integration to stackrox-ui-engineer"
    ‚Üì
stackrox-ui-engineer: "Integrating service into NaturalLanguageSearchInput"
```
