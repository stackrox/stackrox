### A Quick Word from Us
Hello there! We just wanted to drop in and address the elephant in the room. In a [previous release](https://github.com/PagerDuty/go-pagerduty/releases/tag/v1.5.0) we made a promise to maintain API compatibility for future v1 releases. This release contains a few changes that may require minor updates to the way your code interacts with API request and response objects. These changes are necessary in order to make these APIs work properly for as many of you as possible.

One of our goals with this client library is to provide a working client that properly interacts with the [PagerDuty Public API](https://developer.pagerduty.com/api-reference/). While we remain committed to not breaking API compatibility for reasons such as "making the library [better | easier to use | etc.]"; we believe it is in all of our best interest to make this client library work.

As always, we welcome your feedback on this decision via a GitHub issue.

## [v1.5.0](https://github.com/PagerDuty/go-pagerduty/tree/v1.5.0) (2022-01-22) - BREAKING CHANGES

[Milestone](https://github.com/PagerDuty/go-pagerduty/milestone/2)  
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/PagerDuty/go-pagerduty/compare/v1.4.3...v1.5.0)

**NOTICE**

This release is special, and intentionally includes breaking API changes without
bumping the module's major version. We apologize for any inconveience this
causes, but we felt this approach was better than incurring the cost of
releasing v2 today. Specifically, we believed it was best to break the API, so
that you became aware of features you depended on that were not working as you
expected. We welcome your feedback on this decision via a GitHub issue.

These changes largely fix API issues that would have made it impossible for the
this module to be used correctly. Most often this is due to incorrect or invalid
struct fields, others were a lack of required inputs to specific actions.

We commit henceforth to maintaining API compatibility for future v1 releases.

**Highlights**

- Add support for handling signature verification of V3 Webhook requests.
- Update `APIError` type to provide more helpful error strings.
- Add support for API debugging, by allowing capture of the request/response from the API.
- Added various missing fields to different structs.
- Add support for response plays, fetching audit records, and setting up email filters.
