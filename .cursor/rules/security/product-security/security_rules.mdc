# Security Principles

- **Complete Mediation:** Ensure every access request is validated and authorized. No bypasses allowed.
- **Compromise Recording:** Implement mechanisms to detect, record, and respond to security breaches.
- **Defense in Depth:** Use multiple, layered security controls to protect systems and data.
- **Economy of Mechanism:** Keep designs simple and easy to understand. Avoid unnecessary complexity.
- **Least Common Mechanism:** Minimize shared resources and isolate components to reduce risk.
- **Least Privilege:** Grant only the minimum permissions necessary for users and systems.
- **Open Design:** Favor transparency and well-understood mechanisms over security by obscurity.
- **Psychological Acceptability:** Make security controls user-friendly and aligned with user expectations.
- **Secure by Design, Default, Deployment (SD3):** Ship with secure defaults, deny by default, and avoid hardcoded credentials.

# Security Controls

- **Authentication:** Use strong, standard authentication methods. Require authentication for all non-public areas. Store credentials securely and enforce password policies. Use multi-factor authentication where possible.
- **Authorization:** Enforce least privilege and explicit permissions. Use a single, trusted component for authorization checks. Deny by default and audit permissions regularly.
- **Encryption:** Encrypt all network traffic and data at rest where applicable. Use approved certificates and protocols.
- **Logging:** Log security events centrally. Do not log sensitive data. Restrict log access and monitor for suspicious activity.
- **Networking:** Encrypt all communications. Do not expose unnecessary endpoints or ports. Restrict network access to only what is required.

Apply these rules to all code, infrastructure, and processes to maintain a strong security posture across your projects.
