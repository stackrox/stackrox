# Cursor rules

This directory contains a set of [Cursor project rules](https://docs.cursor.com/en/context/rules#project-rules), to steer Cursor's suggestions in ways that benefit the Stackrox development.

The rules in [product-security](product-security/) are imported from [Product Security's Cursor rules](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/product-security/security-cursor-rules).
