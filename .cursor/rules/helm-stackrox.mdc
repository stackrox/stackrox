The directory "image/templates/helm" contains files that are used to generate the Stackrox helm charts. Many of them have the ".htpl" extension, which indicates they are templates from which helm charts will be rendered. When working with any files in that directory always follow these instructions:

- Check for vulnerable dependencies and validate chart provenance.
- Secure configuration and manage secrets outside of values.yaml.
- Use tools like checkov for security scanning.
