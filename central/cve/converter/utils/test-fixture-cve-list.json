For simple installations, Istiod is typically only reachable from within the cluster, limiting the blast radius. However, for some deployments, especially [external istiod](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/install/external-controlplane/) topologies, this port is exposed over the public internet. This issue has been patched in versions 1.13.2, 1.12.5 and 1.11.8. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should disable access to a validating webhook that is exposed to the public internet or restrict the set of IP addresses that can query it to a set of known, trusted entities."}]},"problemtype":{"problemtype_data":[{"description":[{"lang":"en","value":"CWE-400"}]}]},"references":{"reference_data":[{"name":"https://github.com/istio/istio/commit/6ca5055a4db6695ef5504eabdfde3799f2ea91fd","refsource":"MISC","tags":["Third Party Advisory"],"url":"https://github.com/istio/istio/commit/6ca5055a4db6695ef5504eabdfde3799f2ea91fd"}]}},"configurations":{"CVE_data_version":"4.0","nodes":[{"cpe_match":[{"cpe23Uri":"cpe:2.3:a:istio:istio:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","versionEndExcluding":"1.13.2","versionStartIncluding":"1.13.0","vulnerable":true}],"operator":"OR"}]},"impact":{"baseMetricV2":{"cvssV2":{"accessComplexity":"LOW","accessVector":"NETWORK","authentication":"NONE","availabilityImpact":"PARTIAL","baseScore":5,"confidentialityImpact":"NONE","integrityImpact":"NONE","vectorString":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P","version":"2.0"},"exploitabilityScore":10,"impactScore":2.9,"severity":"MEDIUM"},"baseMetricV3":{"cvssV3":{"attackComplexity":"LOW","attackVector":"NETWORK","availabilityImpact":"HIGH","baseScore":7.5,"baseSeverity":"HIGH","confidentialityImpact":"NONE","integrityImpact":"NONE","privilegesRequired":"NONE","scope":"UNCHANGED","userInteraction":"NONE","vectorString":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","version":"3.1"},"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6}},"lastModifiedDate":"2022-03-18T20:20Z"}
