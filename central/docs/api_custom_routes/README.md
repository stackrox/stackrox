This directory includes manually created OpenAPI/Swagger specs for Central's custom routes defined in [/central/main.go](/central/main.go) (refer to `customRoutes()`)

These particular specs are currently NOT accessible via Central, instead they are/will be available in the official docs.

TODO(ROX-28173): improve doc creation, automation, serving, etc..
