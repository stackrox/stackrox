## StackRox-Specific Guidelines

### API Design Standards
- Follow StackRox API guidelines from `.github/api_guidelines.md`
- **Decoupling**: APIs must not expose internal data structures
  - Services in `/proto/api/v2` must not import from `/proto/storage`, `/proto/internalapi`, or `/proto/api/v1`
  - New services in `/proto/api/v1` must not import from `/proto/storage`, `/proto/internalapi`, or `/proto/api/v2`
  - Use dedicated API data structures instead of database/storage structs
- **Naming conventions**:
  - Service names: Use descriptive nouns ending with "Service" (e.g., `DeploymentService`)
  - Method names: Follow VerbNoun pattern with imperative verbs (e.g., `GetDeployment`, `ListDeployments`)
  - Message names: Method name + "Request"/"Response" suffix
  - Field names: lowercase_underscore_separated for proto, auto-converted to camelCase in JSON
- **URL design**:
  - Prefix with API version (`/v1/`, `/v2/`)
  - Use plural resource nouns (`/v1/deployments`)
  - Use hyphens for multi-word components (`/v1/kernel-support`)
  - Path parameters for specific resources (`/v1/deployments/{id}`)
  - Query parameters for filtering (`/v1/cves?deferred=true`)

### Go Coding Style (StackRox-specific)
- **Consistency and readability**: Design types to only be used correctly
- **Error handling**:
  - Use `errors.Wrap[f]()` from `github.com/pkg/errors` for forwarding
  - Use `RoxError.CausedBy[f]()` from `pkg/errox` for adding context
  - Prefer `RoxError.New[f]()` over standard error creation
  - Always check `err != nil` before using results
- **Declarations**:
  - Prefer `var x T` over `x := T{}` for zero values
  - Scope variables as low as possible
  - Follow order: const block, var block, everything else
- **Functions**:
  - Every blocking function receives `ctx context.Context` as first parameter
  - Pass proto objects as pointers, use `obj.CloneVT()` for copies
  - Use `.GetField()` instead of `.Field` on protobuf objects
  - Avoid naked returns
- **Concurrency**:
  - Always use `defer mutex.Unlock()`
  - Use `concurrency.WithLock()` or `concurrency.WithRLock()` for early unlocks
  - Check concurrent correctness when adding `go` keyword
- **File operations**:
  - Only defer `Close()` with `utils.IgnoreError` for read-only operations
  - Must check close error for write operations

### Pull Request Standards
- **Title format**: `ROX-1234: Descriptive title` for JIRA tickets
- **Testing**: Include comprehensive unit tests, integration tests where applicable
- **Checklist**: Complete all applicable items, strike out non-applicable ones
- **Git operations**:
  - Separate commits for incremental changes
  - No merge commits, use rebase for master updates
  - Force-push only after rebasing
- **Code style**: Follow `.github/go-coding-style.md` guidelines
