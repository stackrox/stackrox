# This script works around the fact that RHTAP modifies Dockerfiles provided to it when prefetching dependencies is on.
# RHTAP changes should stop happening after https://issues.redhat.com/browse/STONEBLD-1847
# Additionally, the script returns no-zero if it detects any other changes to the git repo.
#
# If this script is not called and does not fail the build, things like `make tag` will produce `-dirty` suffix
# (as in `4.3.x-63-g09e5188ab9-dirty`) which gets embedded as the version attribute in built binaries.
#
# The script MUST be executed only from within the Dockerfile (not outside of it) because binaries are built inside.

# When executing in RHTAP (as opposed to the script ran directly), we undo RHTAP changes to Dockerfiles.
# I found no better way to detect RHTAP than by checking the presence of cachi2.env file.

    # We can safely restore dockerfiles because the modified version of dockerfile interpreted by docker/buildah stays
    # outside, and these are local copies inside of the build context.

# Next, make sure no other things that make it `-dirty` slipped through. If they did, fail the build.
