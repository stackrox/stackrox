The existence of this file is a disabling feature flag that prevents Konflux replacing GHA for building and pushing
release images.
It is recognized by should-konflux-replace-gha-build.sh

We should remove this file (should-konflux-replace-gha-build.hold) once we're ready to be releasing with Konflux.
