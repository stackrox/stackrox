# This file contains patterns that must not be present in log files of any StackRox service, otherwise the
# test will fail.
# Patterns are in PCRE regex syntax, one per line.
# Lines starting with a `#` as well as blank lines are ignored, but a `#` in the middle of a line is matched as-is.
# If you want to match on a pattern starting with `#`, write `\#`.
