	// Setting this value too low may result in External- or Internal Entities appearing on the Network Graph
	// for connections that could have been attributed to a past deployment.
	// Setting this value too high will result in higher memory consumption of Sensor (especially in clusters with many
	// deletions or frequent dynamic changes to services or IP addresses).
