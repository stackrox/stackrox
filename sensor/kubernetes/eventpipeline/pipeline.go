// New instantiates the eventPipeline component. Sensors pipeline is responsible for the entire lifecycle of a Kubernetes
// event. From receiving it from the listeners, converting it to storage.Deployment, finding related resources to be
// reprocessed, and sending events directly to Central or to the detector for processing.
//
// Components will communicate with each other using component.ResourceEvent data structure. The pipeline is organized as:
//
//	Listener -> Resolver -> Output
//
// Each component will write and consume different properties from ResourceEvent, and send the event to the next component in the chain.
// For an explanation what each property means, check the documentation for component.ResourceEvent.
//
// This component introduces a new type of component to sensor:
// - The event pipeline is a sensor component. That means, it can send messages to the gRPC stream via the .ResponseC function.
// - Pipeline components are sub-components inside the event pipeline that process a kubernetes event from start to finish (listener, resolver and output are all pipeline components)
