// OrderedBundleResourceTypes is the list of all k8s resource types that are (or were at some point) relevant for the sensor
// bundle. They should be ordered according to the preferred creation order. If there are multiple versions of the
// same resource kind, they should be in ascending order.
// IMPORTANT: Any resource type that is part of a sensor bundle deployment (either in a YAML or indirectly via a
//
//	`kubectl` command invocation) must be listed here, otherwise the auto-upgrade will fail.
//
// NEVER REMOVE ELEMENTS FROM THIS LIST, OTHERWISE UPGRADES MIGHT FAIL IN UNEXPECTED WAYS. The upgrader logic
// automatically detects the resources supported by the server, having GroupVersionKinds that are no longer supported
// hence does not hurt.
