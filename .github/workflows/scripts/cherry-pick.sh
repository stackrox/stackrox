As some of the PRs could not be cherry-picked, please help the authors to merge
their changes to the release branch via opening PRs.

The commands may look like the following (mind the placeholders):

    # In the directory of the $GITHUB_REPOSITORY clone:
    git switch "$main_branch"
    git pull
    git switch --create <AUTHOR>/merge-pr-<PR NUMBER>-"$RELEASE_PATCH" \\
      "$BRANCH"
    git cherry-pick -x <MERGE COMMIT SHA>

    # Proceed to resolve merge conflicts. Once done:
    git push --set-upstream origin \$(git branch --show-current)

    # Create PR to the release branch (assuming 'gh' is installed):
    gh create pr --base "$BRANCH" --fill \\
      --milestone "$MILESTONE"
EOF
    exit 1
fi
