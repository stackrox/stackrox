While it doesn't expose data or require user interaction, it poses a high integrity risk and is especially concerning in environments that rely on automated package handling or internal tooling built on setuptools.","link":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-47273","fixedBy":"0:39.2.0-9.el8_10","scoreVersion":"V3","cvssV2":null,"cvssV3":{"vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:L","exploitabilityScore":2.8,"impactScore":4.2,"attackVector":"ATTACK_NETWORK","attackComplexity":"COMPLEXITY_LOW","privilegesRequired":"PRIVILEGE_LOW","userInteraction":"UI_NONE","scope":"UNCHANGED","confidentiality":"IMPACT_NONE","integrity":"IMPACT_HIGH","availability":"IMPACT_LOW","score":7.1,"severity":"HIGH"},"publishedOn":"2025-05-17T15:46:11.399Z","lastModified":null,"vulnerabilityType":"IMAGE_VULNERABILITY","vulnerabilityTypes":["IMAGE_VULNERABILITY"],"suppressed":false,"suppressActivation":null,"suppressExpiry":null,"firstSystemOccurrence":"2025-08-06T16:38:25.798658269Z","firstImageOccurrence":"2025-08-06T16:38:25.798658269Z","severity":"MODERATE_VULNERABILITY_SEVERITY","state":"OBSERVED","cvssMetrics":[{"source":"SOURCE_RED_HAT","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-47273","cvssv3":{"vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:L","exploitabilityScore":2.8,"impactScore":4.2,"attackVector":"ATTACK_NETWORK","attackComplexity":"COMPLEXITY_LOW","privilegesRequired":"PRIVILEGE_LOW","userInteraction":"UI_NONE","scope":"UNCHANGED","confidentiality":"IMPACT_NONE","integrity":"IMPACT_HIGH","availability":"IMPACT_LOW","score":7.1,"severity":"HIGH"}},{"source":"SOURCE_NVD","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-47273","cvssv3":{"vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","exploitabilityScore":2.8,"impactScore":5.9,"attackVector":"ATTACK_NETWORK","attackComplexity":"COMPLEXITY_LOW","privilegesRequired":"PRIVILEGE_LOW","userInteraction":"UI_NONE","scope":"UNCHANGED","confidentiality":"IMPACT_HIGH","integrity":"IMPACT_HIGH","availability":"IMPACT_HIGH","score":8.8,"severity":"HIGH"}}],"nvdCvss":8.8,"epss":{"epssProbability":0.00162,"epssPercentile":0.3782}}],"layerIndex":60,"priority":174,"source":"OS","location":"var/lib/rpm","topCvss":7.1,"riskScore":0,"fixedBy":"0:39.2.0-9.el8_10","executables":[],"architecture":"noarch"},{"name":"github.com/russross/blackfriday/v2","version":"v2.1.0","license":null,"vulns":[],"layerIndex":96,"priority":174,"source":"GO","location":"usr/local/bin/fleetshard-operator","riskScore":0,"fixedBy":"","executables":[],"architecture":""},{"name":"openssl","version":"1:1.1.1k-14.el8_6","license":null,"vulns":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-0466","advisory":null,"cvss":5.3,"summary":"A flaw was found in OpenSSL.

By sending specially constructed checksum values for arbitrary files, an attacker may be able to reconstruct the data of those files byte-by-byte based on the responses from the client.","link":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-12086","scoreVersion":"V3","cvssV2":null,"cvssV3":{"vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N","exploitabilityScore":1.6,"impactScore":4,"attackVector":"ATTACK_NETWORK","attackComplexity":"COMPLEXITY_HIGH","privilegesRequired":"PRIVILEGE_NONE","userInteraction":"UI_REQUIRED","scope":"CHANGED","confidentiality":"IMPACT_HIGH","integrity":"IMPACT_NONE","availability":"IMPACT_NONE","score":6.1,"severity":"MEDIUM"},"publishedOn":"2025-01-14T15:06:00Z","lastModified":null,"vulnerabilityType":"IMAGE_VULNERABILITY","vulnerabilityTypes":["IMAGE_VULNERABILITY"],"suppressed":false,"suppressActivation":null,"suppressExpiry":null,"firstSystemOccurrence":"2025-01-15T02:24:34.692014324Z","firstImageOccurrence":"2025-07-21T09:30:35.537206622Z","severity":"MODERATE_VULNERABILITY_SEVERITY","state":"OBSERVED","cvssMetrics":[{"source":"SOURCE_RED_HAT","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-12086","cvssv3":{"vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N","exploitabilityScore":1.6,"impactScore":4,"attackVector":"ATTACK_NETWORK","attackComplexity":"COMPLEXITY_HIGH","privilegesRequired":"PRIVILEGE_NONE","userInteraction":"UI_REQUIRED","scope":"CHANGED","confidentiality":"IMPACT_HIGH","integrity":"IMPACT_NONE","availability":"IMPACT_NONE","score":6.1,"severity":"MEDIUM"}},{"source":"SOURCE_NVD","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-12086","cvssv3":{"vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N","exploitabilityScore":2.2,"impactScore":4,"attackVector":"ATTACK_NETWORK","attackComplexity":"COMPLEXITY_HIGH","privilegesRequired":"PRIVILEGE_NONE","userInteraction":"UI_NONE","scope":"CHANGED","confidentiality":"IMPACT_HIGH","integrity":"IMPACT_NONE","availability":"IMPACT_NONE","score":6.8,"severity":"MEDIUM"}}],"nvdCvss":6.8,"epss":{"epssProbability":0.00193,"epssPercentile":0.41521}},{"cve":"CVE-2016-9840","advisory":{"name":"RHSA-2025:8395","link":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:8395"},"cvss":8.8,"summary":"A vulnerability was discovered in the inftrees.c file of zlib.

This could result in differential parsing across the Python URL parser and other specification-compliant URL parsers.","link":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-0938","scoreVersion":"V3","cvssV2":null,"cvssV3":{"vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N","exploitabilityScore":2.2,"impactScore":4,"attackVector":"ATTACK_NETWORK","attackComplexity":"COMPLEXITY_HIGH","privilegesRequired":"PRIVILEGE_NONE","userInteraction":"UI_NONE","scope":"CHANGED","confidentiality":"IMPACT_NONE","integrity":"IMPACT_HIGH","availability":"IMPACT_NONE","score":6.8,"severity":"MEDIUM"},"publishedOn":"2025-01-31T17:51:35.898Z","lastModified":null,"vulnerabilityType":"IMAGE_VULNERABILITY","vulnerabilityTypes":["IMAGE_VULNERABILITY"],"suppressed":false,"suppressActivation":null,"suppressExpiry":null,"firstSystemOccurrence":"2025-02-01T02:08:30.384513275Z","firstImageOccurrence":"2025-07-21T09:30:35.537206622Z","severity":"MODERATE_VULNERABILITY_SEVERITY","state":"OBSERVED","cvssMetrics":[{"source":"SOURCE_RED_HAT","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-0938","cvssv3":{"vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N","exploitabilityScore":2.2,"impactScore":4,"attackVector":"ATTACK_NETWORK","attackComplexity":"COMPLEXITY_HIGH","privilegesRequired":"PRIVILEGE_NONE","userInteraction":"UI_NONE","scope":"CHANGED","confidentiality":"IMPACT_NONE","integrity":"IMPACT_HIGH","availability":"IMPACT_NONE","score":6.8,"severity":"MEDIUM"}}],"nvdCvss":0,"epss":{"epssProbability":0.00801,"epssPercentile":0.73283}},{"cve":"CVE-2022-0391","advisory":null,"cvss":5.3,"summary":"A flaw was found in Python, specifically within the urllib.parse module.
