  "description": "Alert on deployments with images containing the Log4Shell vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228). This is a flaw in the Java logging library Apache Log4j in versions from 2.0.0 and before as well as version 2.14.1.",
  "rationale": "This vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute code on the server if the system logs an attacker-controlled string value with the attacker's JNDI LDAP server lookup.",
  "remediation": "Update the log4j libary to version 2.15.0 (which disables the feature by default), 2.16.0 (which removes the functionality) or later. If not possible to upgrade, there are two possible mitigations for this flaw in versions from 2.10 to 2.14.1: Set the system property log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups to true, or remove the JndiLookup class from the classpath.",
