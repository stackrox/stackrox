  "description": "Alert on containers with fixable vulnerabilities with a CVSS of at least 7. While we suggest to rely on Severity instead of CVSS by default, you may want to favor CVSS, for example, because of FedRAMP requirements. If you decide to use this policy, consider disabling 'Containers with Fixable CVEs and Severity at least Important' to avoid multiple violations for the same problem.",
