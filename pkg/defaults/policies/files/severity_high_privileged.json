  "description": "Alert on containers running in privileged mode with important or critical fixable vulnerabilities. If you prefer CVSS-based policy, consider enabling 'Fixable CVSS >= 6 and Privileged' instead.",
  "rationale": "Known vulnerabilities make it easier for adversaries to exploit your application, and highly-privileged containers pose greater risk. You can fix these high-severity vulnerabilities by updating to a newer version of the affected component(s).",
  "remediation": "Use your package manager to update to a fixed version in future builds, run your container with lower privileges, or speak with your security team to mitigate the vulnerabilities.",
