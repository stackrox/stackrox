## Workflow

### Test Failure Triaging

When a user request or prompt is prefixed with "triage" key word you must switch to the
test failure triage workflow. It consists of the following steps:

- confirm that the user request or prompt contains test failure information, if not,
  ask the user how to proceed
- analyze the provided request or prompt and identify what type the test in question is
- think hard about the root cause, present your findings to the user; do not write any code
- ask for more information if necessary: context, logs, whatever you think might help with triaging

### Committing Generated Code

When a user asks to commit a change made entirely or partially with the help of an AI
agent (like yourself), you must switch to the code committing workflow. It includes the
following requirements:

- individual commits must be atomic, minimal, and group changes logically where possible
- always include the associated user request or prompt into the commit message
- be concise in your commit messages, briefly state the problem and the solution while
  focussing on what is not clear from the code itself: considered alternatives, assumptions
  being made, etc
- include a note that the code was partially generated by AI

### Creating Pull Requests

When creating pull requests, you must follow these requirements:

- always create PRs as draft - use the `--draft` flag with `gh pr create`
- this allows for review and additional changes before marking as ready for review
- PR description must follow the template (`.github/pull_request_template.md`)
  - IMPORTANT: all sections, checkboxes, and structure must be preserved
  - only remove: HTML comments (`<!-- -->`) and placeholder text (e.g., "change me!")
  - do not remove: section headers, checkboxes, or any structural content
  - fill in all required sections and check appropriate boxes

## Architecture Overview

StackRox is a Kubernetes-native security platform with a distributed microservices architecture:

### Core Components
- **Central** (`/central/`) - Go-based API server, policy engine, and management hub with PostgreSQL storage
- **Sensor** (`/sensor/`) - Go-based Kubernetes monitoring agent deployed per cluster
- **Scanner** (`/scanner/`) - Go-based vulnerability scanning service using ClairCore
- **UI** (`/ui/`) - React/TypeScript frontend with modern web stack
- **roxctl** (`/roxctl/`) - Go-based CLI tool for administration and CI/CD integration
- **Operator** (`/operator/`) - Kubernetes operator for lifecycle management

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Go (1.24.0+), PostgreSQL, gRPC/HTTP APIs, Kubernetes controllers
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Node.js (20.0.0+), npm
- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes-native, Helm charts, Docker/Podman containers
- **Communication**: mTLS for security, gRPC for internal services, REST APIs for external access

### Deployment Model
- **Central Services**: Deployed in management cluster (Central, Scanner, UI, Database)
- **Secured Cluster Services**: Deployed per monitored cluster (Sensor, Admission Controller)
- **Multi-cluster support**: One Central instance monitors multiple Kubernetes clusters

### Key Directories
- `/central/` - Central management service code
- `/sensor/` - Sensor agent code for cluster monitoring
- `/scanner/` - Vulnerability scanning service
- `/ui/` - Web frontend application
- `/roxctl/` - Command-line interface
- `/operator/` - Kubernetes operator
- `/generated/` - Auto-generated code from protobuf definitions
- `/proto/` - Protocol buffer definitions
- `/pkg/` - Shared Go libraries and utilities
- `/deploy/` - Deployment scripts and configurations
- `/qa-tests-backend/` - Integration tests (Groovy/Spock)

### Development Workflow
1. Use `make install-dev-tools` to set up development environment
2. Run `make proto-generated-srcs` when protobuf files change
3. Use `make fast-central` or `make fast-sensor` for quick development iterations
4. Run `make style` before committing to ensure code quality
5. Use `./deploy/deploy-local.sh` for local testing with existing k8s cluster

### Environment Variables
- `STORAGE=pvc` - Persist PostgreSQL data between restarts
- `SKIP_UI_BUILD=1` - Skip UI builds to speed up development
- `SKIP_CLI_BUILD=1` - Skip CLI builds to speed up development
- `DEBUG_BUILD=yes` - Create debug build with debugging capabilities
- `MAIN_IMAGE_TAG` - Override default image tag for deployments

### Testing Notes
- PostgreSQL integration tests require Postgres running on port 5432
- Use `docker run --rm --env POSTGRES_USER="$USER" --env POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust --publish 5432:5432 docker.io/library/postgres:13` for test setup
- Integration tests in `/qa-tests-backend/` use Groovy/Spock framework
- Tests marked with `//go:build sql_integration` require database connectivity

### Style and Conventions
- Go code follows golangci-lint standards
- Additional project specific style guide in `.github/go-coding-style.md`
- Protocol buffers have enforced style guidelines
- Shell scripts are checked with shellcheck
- UI code uses TypeScript with React conventions
- All generated code should not be manually edited
