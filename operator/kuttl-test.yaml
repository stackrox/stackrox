# central-db pod takes a while do become healthy, typically ~25s, but sometimes over a minute since container start.
# Especially when there are intermittent issues re-attaching PVCs after a pod reschedule on a different node.
# We need to add CR reconciliation, pod creation and image fetch to that.
# Set the timeout very high so that we can collect a distribution of realistic times and later set to a flake-safe timeout.
