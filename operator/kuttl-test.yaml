# central pod takes a while do become healthy, typically ~25s, but sometimes over a minute since container start.
# We need to add CR reconciliation, pod creation and image fetch to that.
# Set the timeout very high so that we can collect a distribution of realistic times and later set to a flake-safe timeout.

# The following stackrox_namespaces commands are only necessary because we only support a fixed namespace name, which in turn requires
# kuttl --namespace flag, and this in turn requires namespace to be in place before we start testing.
# If/when we support arbitrary namespaces, then we can drop --namespace and the following commands,
# and kuttl will create and clean up ephemeral namespaces for us, with the additional ability to run tests in parallel.
# This first command is a no-op if namespace already exists, but ensures that the second command (delete) does not fail.
- command: kubectl apply -f tests/stackrox_namespaces.yaml
# This is needed to clean up stale resources (PVC, etc) from previous tests, if any.
- command: kubectl delete -f tests/stackrox_namespaces.yaml
# Namespace needs to exist to use kuttl with --namespace
- command: kubectl apply -f tests/stackrox_namespaces.yaml
# Set up operand image pull secrets for development.
