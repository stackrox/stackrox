# This file specifies values for the stackrox-central-services chart that are always applied
# in the context of the operator. The settings here mostly take care of disabling any features
# that auto-generate values (in a random fashion, such as certificates and the admin password),
# or inspect the current cluster state (unavailable on dry-run, which operator uses to determine
# if an upgrade should happen).
# This is important to ensure that the generated Helm manifest is deterministically derived
# from the cluster state; otherwise, the operator would trigger a `helm upgrade` every time the
# reconciliation loop is executed, regardless of changes to the CR.
