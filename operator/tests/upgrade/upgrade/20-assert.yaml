# An assert for healthy Central+SecuredCluster including a check for deployed product version.
# Since the product version is variable, and kuttl does not natively support such variance,
# we implement this assert as a nested `kuttl assert` and expand the product version using envsubst.
apiVersion: kuttl.dev/v1beta1
kind: TestAssert
commands:
- script: |
    set -eu # shell in CI does not grok -o pipefail
    assert_file=$(mktemp)
    # Note: apparently $PWD is NOT set to directory of this file for TestAssert but it is for TestStep
    env - PATH=$PATH PRODUCT_VERSION=$NEW_PRODUCT_VERSION envsubst < tests/common/upgrade-assert.envsubst.yaml > $assert_file
    # Note: As of kuttl 0.11.0 the timeout value actually means "the number of attempts".
    # With 5 objects in the assert file, each attempt typically takes ~18 seconds (including the 1s sleep between attempts),
    # although it can occasionally take significantly longer, see https://github.com/kudobuilder/kuttl/issues/321
    # So we specify a timeout value of 16, aiming for under 5 minutes.
