    # Note: As of kuttl 0.11.0 the timeout value actually means "the number of attempts".
    # With 6 objects in the assert file, each attempt typically takes ~22 seconds (including the 1s sleep between attempts),
    # although it can occasionally take significantly longer, see https://github.com/kudobuilder/kuttl/issues/321
    # So we specify a timeout value of 13, aiming for under 5 minutes.
