# The central CR and its operands are gone in previous step.
# However, the SecuredCluster reconciler should notice Central disappearing and
# create a local scanner now that the central scanner is gone.
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment

  name: scanner
# We do not assert anything about the status, since - with Central gone - scanner
# might not be able to become healthy. Even if it does, we are only interested
# in testing that the SecuredCluster reconciler was triggered correctly here.
