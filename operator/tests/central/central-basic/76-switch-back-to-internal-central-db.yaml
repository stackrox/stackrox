# The previous step (75-switch-to-external-central-db) has caused the initially generated
# central-db-password secret to be overwritten with a manually specified "external" password.
# The DB PVC was left behind, but it's difficult to extract the password from there.
# Instead, we now remove the central DB PVC, to cause the operator create a new one such that
# it can be populated with a freshly generated DB password.
