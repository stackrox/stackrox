# Cache deps before building and copying source so that we don't need to re-download as much and so that source changes
# don't invalidate our downloaded layer.
# We're not using `go mod tidy` here becuase go mod tidy needs to examine _source code_ in order to find unused modules.
# There's no source code in this docker layer yet and so `go mod tidy` would empty go.mod and go.sum which is not what
# we want. If we're to COPY source before running `go mod tidy`, local docker build times would go up because any code
# change will invalidate docker layers and will cause modules redownload (during `tidy`). Therefore we use
# `go mod download` as a compromise for shorter local build times due to docker layer caching. There are CI checks
# ensuring that there will not be unused modules for the repo overall.
# Note that `go mod download` can donwload more stuff than `go mod tidy` https://github.com/golang/go/issues/43994
# However it does _not_ seem to resolve packages _incorrectly_ and so should be safe especially given that downloaded
# packages are only used during build and later this docker layer is discarded (only resulting binary goes in the final
# image).
# Retry as the proxy can be unavailable at times.
