# These patches remove the unnecessary "cert" volume and its manager container volumeMount.
# The patch is only required for OLM-based installations.
# This is because OLM creates volumes and volumeMounts itself dynamically at runtime, so we need to remove them here to prevent clashes.
# In other words, the patch will NOT be executed for non-OLM-based installations.
# Should be kept in sync with operator/config/default/manager_webhook_patch.yaml.
